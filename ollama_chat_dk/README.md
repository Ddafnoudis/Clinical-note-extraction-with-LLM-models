# Chating with ollama (llama3) model for extraction of symptoms from clinical danish text

The <ollama_chat_dk> folder generates two DataFrames, one in English and one in Danish. We use the Danish dummy clinical notes.

We create chat using ollama(llama3) chat model and we figure the prompts that:
1) Give the input text data to the model
2) Gives the prompts
3) Stores the results
